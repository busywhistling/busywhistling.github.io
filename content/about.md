I am a software engineer in Berlin, with expertise in [full-stack
development](/code). So far, I had been doing a math PhD at the
Humboldt-Universität in Berlin. You can get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/busywhistling), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paramjit-org/) or
[email](mailto:contact@paramjit.org).

## Math research & teaching
I'm currently finishing my math PhD under [Prof. Chris
Wendl](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/) at the
[Humboldt-Universität](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/en/front-page-en) in
[Berlin](https://www.math-berlin.de/). My research focused on holomorphic curves in different contexts of symplectic/contact geometry.

My master's [thesis](/docs/master-thesis-paramjit.pdf) back
at the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) focused on being
a graduate introduction to J-holomorphic curves in symplectic topology.

Over 2015-19, I've assisted in teaching various mathematics and programming courses at CMI, aimed at bachelor's and master's students.
