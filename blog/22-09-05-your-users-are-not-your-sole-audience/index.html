their source code. As if getting up to speed with the latest tech stacks &
platforms was not challenging enough, the industry (not without reason) places
great emphasis on <em>how you code</em>. One hears about phrases like <em>human centric
design</em> & <em>testability,</em> and wonders what the problem is if one&rsquo;s software <em>just
works</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Why can&rsquo;t the thing just work?</p></blockquote><p>One needs to undergo a <em>mindset shift</em> to realize that code must be written not
only to make the end product work, but also to be readable to other developers.
That is, of course, if one does not wish to solo their way through the entire
project lifecycle (not a great idea for anything long term).</p><p>So the idea to internalize is that your <em>source code</em> is also a product. That&rsquo;s
the product you use to demonstrate your skills (<em>sell</em>) to your future
employers/collaborators, with whom you then collectively sell your <em>software</em> to
users. Once you have this mental model set up, it&rsquo;s much easier to make sense of
software engineering <em>culture</em> and **understand where the vast amount of
literature (blog posts, video, podcasts, etc) comes from.</p><h2 id=social-trumps-all><em>Social</em> trumps all</h2><p>Human beings tend to get social about the things they do, no matter how
technical or mathematical they are. That&rsquo;s called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law>Conway&rsquo;s
law</a> or something. Namely that
organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. What
happens if you apply this law to an industry? See what I mean?</p><p>People generally also care more about the social aspect of their work than just
technical correctness, or even mastery. That&rsquo;s why opinions, conventions and
standards start to matter. Developers have tastes and it&rsquo;s easier to work
together when those tastes are in tune. That&rsquo;s one reason (among others) why you
hear <em>empathy</em> talked about so much in developer circles.</p><h2 id=organizational-thinking>Organizational thinking</h2><p>There&rsquo;s another important aspect. Any large influential project or organization
must necessarily involve many people. While it may naively seem that multiplying
effort multiplies output, it takes great foresight & management skills to make
<em>one plus one greater than two.</em></p><h2 id=behaving-oneself>Behaving oneself</h2><p>Most of the non-programming skills engineers need to master are just that.
Project management skills in the context of software. While much of this is
commonly learnt like gospel, in a “this is how you do it” sort of way, there&rsquo;s
value in sticking to the basics and realizing that professional engineering is a
social process, and there are notions of manners. While many of these manners
aim to improve productivity / simplify architecture, some of them have
idiosyncratic origins. And that&rsquo;s ok. Just important to distinguish them from
the technical skills, to understand the motivations behind workflow choices.</p><small>This article was cross-posted to <a href=https://medium.com/@busywhistling/your-users-are-not-your-sole-audience-b4248dbe44f4>Medium</a> & <a href=https://dev.to/busywhistling/your-users-are-not-your-sole-audience-3hm0>Dev.to</a>, so you can also follow there or post comments.</small></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Modified <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
