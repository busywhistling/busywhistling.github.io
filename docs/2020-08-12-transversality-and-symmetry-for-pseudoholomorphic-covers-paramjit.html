              <b>Abstract.</b><br />
              Moduli spaces of simple (or somewhere injective in the closed
              setting) pseudoholomorphic curves arise as smooth manifolds. In
              this talk, we present some ideas for the multiply covered case.
              That is the question of equivariant transversality – do generic
              equivariant sections of an orbi-bundle intersect the zero section
              transversally? In particular, we outline results like unbranched
              multiple covers of closed curves are generically regular and
              simple index 0 curves in dimension greater than four are
              generically super-rigid. We also indicate some partial results for
              regularity of branched covers, using a stratification argument for
              spaces of multiple covers, framed in terms of a
              representation-theoretic splitting of Cauchy Riemann operators
              with symmetries.<br />

          <h2>Relevant background on pseudoholomorphic curves</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              We first present some background on pseudoholomorphic curves
              (details can be found in [Wen2] or [MS]) needed in the following
              discussion. For \((\Sigma, j)\) a closed Riemann surface and
              \((M,J)\) an almost complex manifold, a \(J\) -holomorphic or
              pseudoholomorphic (or often just <i>holomorphic</i>) curve \(u :
              (\Sigma, j) \to (M,J)\) is a smooth map satisfying \(\d u \circ j
              = J \circ \d u\). Such curves behave analogous to holomorphic
              curves in complex analysis, and have been widely studied ever
              since Gromov used them in 1985 to prove rigidity phenomena in
              symplectic topology (the most notable example being the
              <i>non-squeezing theorem</i>).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is useful to take a global perspective and study the entire
              space of holomorphic curves in a manifold. Such a viewpoint is
              useful in topology since we are often only concerned with maps
              upto perturbations and the study of entire families often gives us
              information about the curves in that family. In this respect, let
              \(\mathcal{B} = \cinf(\Sigma, M)\) be the space of smooth maps
              from \(\Sigma\) to \(M\) and for a map \(u \in \mathcal{B}\),
              consider the space of \(u^*TM\) valued \((0,1)\) forms
              \(\mathcal{E}_u = \Omega^{0,1}(\Sigma, u^* TM)\). These vector
              spaces together form an “infinite-dimensional vector bundle”
              \(\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}\). Using the definition of
              holomorphic curves, we arrive at a particular section
              \(\delbar_J(u) = 1/2 (\d u + J \circ \d u \circ j)\) of the bundle
              \(\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}\). Under this formulation,
              holomorphic curves are precisely the zero set of this section,
              i.e., solutions to \(\delbar_J(u) = 0\) (this is the
              <i>nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation</i>).
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out that under suitable hypotheses, the space of such
              curves is indeed a smooth manifold. In finite dimensional
              differential geometry, we have that level sets of regular values
              for a smooth map between manifolds is a regular submanifold of the
              domain. Trying to imitate that in the global perspective described
              earlier, we find that \(0\) is in some sense a regular value for
              the \(\delbar_J\) operator (more formally, \(\delbar_J\) is a
              Fredholm section with respect to suitable Sobolev completions of
              \(\mathcal{E}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\)).
            </p>
            <p>
              To outline the hypotheses, we introduce the notion of
              <i>simple curves</i>. Recall from complex analysis, that any
              holomorphic map between closed Riemann surfaces is either a
              biholomorphism or a cover of some kind. Similarly, a JH curve \(u
              : \Sigma \to M\) is <i>multiply covered</i> if there is a compact
              RS \((\Sigma', j')\), a JH curve \(v : \Sigma' \to M\) and a
              holomorphic branched covering \(\varphi : \Sigma \to \Sigma'\)
              such that \(u = v \circ \varphi\). The curve is <i>simple</i> if
              its not mulitply covered, the analogue of biholomorphisms from
              complex analysis. In the closed setting, these curves are the same
              as <i>somewhere injective curves</i> (curves \(u\) which are
              injective somewhere, that is, \(\exists z\) such that \(\d u(z)
              \ne 0\) and \(u^{-1}(u(z)) = \{z\}\)). It turns out that
              <i>any</i> holomorphic curve can be shown to factor through a
              simple curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let \((M,\w)\) be a symplectic manifold. Then for a
              <i>generic</i> \(\w\) compatible almost complex structure \(J\)
              (that is to say, for \(J\) in a comeager subset of the space of
              all \(\w\) compatible acs), the space of simple JH curves
              representing a particular homology \(A \in H_2(M)\) is a smooth
              manifold of dimension given by an index formula (namely, the
              Riemann Roch fomula).
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that we are done with the story of simple curves, a natural
              question which arises is what happens for multiple covers? Can we
              make similar statements about the space of multiple covers of a
              particular type?
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>The case of multiple covers</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              We begin with a discussion of unbranched covers. If \(u : (\Sigma,
              j) \to (M,J)\) is a closed JH curve and \(\varphi :
              (\Tilde{\Sigma}, \Tilde{j}) \to (\Sigma, j)\) is an
              <i>unbranched</i> \(d:1\) cover of closed surfaces, then the
              virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces containing \(u\) and \(u
              \circ \varphi : (\Tilde{\Sigma}, \Tilde{j}) \to (M,J)\), also
              known as the <i>indices</i> of these two curves (<font color="red"
                >Achtung!</font
              >
              The latter index would be the “expected” dimension of the space of
              <b>all</b> curves (simple or not) close to \(u \circ \varphi\),
              <b>not</b> only the \(d\) fold covers, as mentioned in the talk.
              Thanks to Ramadas for the question!), are related by \[ \ind(u
              \circ \varphi) = d \cdot \ind(u) \ge 0. \] Since \(\ind(u \circ
              \varphi) \ge 0\) if \(u\) were simple (and \(J\) regular, etc),
              there is no obvious reason why \(u \circ \varphi\) could not
              achieve transversality generically, but traditional methods in the
              theory for simple curves doesn’t generalize to this situation (the
              proof for simple curves uses the existence of an injective point
              to prove surjectivity of an operator). For branched covers, things
              are more subtle.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the ways to study the problem of multiple covers is to
              study the automorphism group of the cover itself. This leads us to
              the question of how symmetry interacts with transversality in
              general. We begin with an example in the finite dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider a smooth map \(f : \Z^2 \to \Z^2\) which is \(\Z_2\)
              equivariant in the sense \(f(x,-y) = -f(x,y)\). One can show that
              for every such map, there are <b>no</b> close
              <i>\(\Z_2\) equivariant</i> perturbations for which \(\vec{0}\) is
              a regular value (<font color="red">Achtung!</font> Contrary to
              what was said in the talk, the method to prove that generic
              functions on a smooth manifold are Morse, <b>fails to work</b> in
              this case). This happens because the entire \(x\) axis \(\R \x
              \{0\} \In f^{-1}(0) \forall\) such \(f\), so \(\del_x f =
              \vec{0}\) along the \(x\) axis. As a result we donot have
              transversality in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best case scenario is that generic \(f\) intersect zero
              <i>cleanly</i>, i.e., all components of \(f^{-1}(0)\) are
              submanifolds with \[ T_x(f^{-1}(0)) = \ker{\d f(x)}. \]
            </p>

            <p>
              The notion of clean intersection is the only other thing one could
              come up with for an intersection set to be a manifold other than
              transversality. Two submanifolds \(M, N \In X\) are said to
              intersect <i>cleanly</i> if \(T_x(M \cap N) = T_x M \cap T_x N\),
              in such a case, we again have that \(M \cap N\) is a smooth
              submanifold of both \(M\) and \(N\). The moral is that we cannot
              always have transversality and symmetry at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because we took the global perspective of the space of holomorphic
              functions being the zero set of the \(\delbar_J\) section, a lot
              of the theory of JH curves is really about understanding bundles
              and sections of those bundles, when they intersect the zero
              section transversally or cleanly, etc. Let’s set up this language
              first in finite dimensions.

                Fix an \(n\) dimensional orbifold \(M\) and an orbibundle \(E
                \to M\) of rank \(m\). Every \(x \in M\) has a finite group
                \(G_x\) and a neighborhood \(U_x \In M\) such that \[ E|_{U_x}
                \isom (\mathcal{O} \x \R^m)/G_x \]

                for some linear action of \(G_x\) on \(\R^m\) and a neighborhood
                \(\mathcal{O} \In \R^n\) of \(0\).
              </p>
              <p>
                The question to ask is if generic \(\sigma \in \Gamma(E)\)
                intersect the zero-section transversely (or at least cleanly).
                There are some theorems answering this question in some
                contexts:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sample theorem 1: If \(\dim{M} = \rk{E}\) and \(|G_x| \le 3\)
                  for all \(x\), then generic sections of \(E\) intersect zero
                  cleanly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sample theorem 2: Generic smooth functions on an orbifold are
                  Morse. (cf. Wasserman ’69, Hepworth ’09).

              <p>
                The perspective we shall take towards considering equivariant
                sections (i.e., sections of the orbibundle) is to break up our
                manifold into parts where the local isotropy groups
                <i>act in the same way</i>. This is the notion of
                stratification.

                <b>Ingredient A:</b> <i>Stratification via symmetry</i><br />
                For any finite group \(G\) and representations \(\rho : G \to
                GL(n,\R)\), \(\tau : G \to GL(m,\R)\), define the
                <i>submanifold</i> \[ M_{\rho, \tau} = \{x \in M \st G_x \isom
                G, \text{ acting on} \\ T_x M \text{ as } \rho \text{ and on } E_x

                \(\{\theta_i : G \to \Aut_{\R}(W_i)\}_{i=1}^N\) denote the real
                irreducible representations of \(G\), with \(\theta_1\) as the
                trivial representation, and let \(m_i(\rho) :=\) multiplicity of
                \(\theta_i\) in \(\rho\). Then \[ \dim(M_{\rho, \tau}) =
                m_1(\rho), \qquad \rk{E_{\rho, \tau}} = m_1(\tau). \] The
                orbifold \(M\) is thus a countable union of disjoint smooth
                submanifolds \(M_{\rho, \tau}\) with distinguished subbundles
                \(E_{\rho, \tau} \In E|_{M_{\rho, \tau}}\).

              <p>
                We now have:<br />

                So we have partial transversality in the above sense. We still
                however, cannot conclude from this that \(\mathcal{M}(\sigma)\)
                is anything as nice as a smooth orbifold. Under certain
                circumstances, we can still push this to say that the space is

            <p>
              In the general branched case, it is harder to achieve
              transversality as mentioned earlier. Let us consider \(u \circ
              \varphi\), where \(u\) is a closed simple curve and \(\varphi\) is
              a degree \(d\) branched cover. Let \(Z(\d \varphi)\) denote the
              algebraic count of branch points. Then, the Riemann Hurwitz
              formula \[ -\chi(\Tilde{\Sigma}) + d \chi(\Tilde{\Sigma}) = Z(\d
              \varphi) \] and the standard index formula for closed curves, give
              us \[ \ind(u \circ \varphi) = d \cdot \ind(u) -(n-3) Z(\d \varphi)
              \] where \(\dim_{\R}(M) = 2n\). If \(\ind(u) = 0\) and \(n &gt;
              3\), then \(\ind(u \circ \varphi) &lt; 0\). So, there is no reason
              to expect transversality in this case. More seriously, if \(u\) is
              regular, then one can always find a smooth family of other
              multiple covers near \(u \circ \varphi\) obtained by varying both
              \(u\) and \(\varphi\) in their respective moduli spaces; since the
              latter lives in a space of real dimension \(2Z(\d \varphi)\), the
              condition \[ \ind(u \circ \varphi) \ge \ind(u) + 2Z(\d \varphi) \]
              is evidently necessary in order for \(u \circ \varphi\) to be
              Fredholm regular. One of the ways to achieve this is if
              \(\varphi\) has \(r \ge 0\) critical values, then the above
              condition is satisfied whenever \(\ind(u) \ge (n-1)r\) (refer
              [Wen1] pg 6 for a calculation). The following result says that
              this is also, in some sense, sufficient to achieve transversality.

            <h3>Super-rigidity for index 0 immersed curves</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Note that \(\ind(u) = \ind(D_u)\) that is, the index of the
                linearized CR operator. Observe that \(u\) must be immersed if
                \(J\) is generic, so it has a well-defined normal bundle \(N_u
                \to \Sigma\), and restricting the linearized CR operators for
                \(u\) and \(u \circ \varphi\) to the normal bundle and its
                pullback gives operators \(D^N_u := D_u|_{N_u}\) and \(D^N_{u
                \circ \varphi}\). Consider these normal operators, we have a new
                index relation similar to the one earlier, namely \[ \ind(D^N_{u
                \circ \varphi}) = d \cdot \ind(D^N_u) - (n-1)Z(\d \varphi). \]
                Note that for immersed curves, Fredholm regularity can also be
                characterized by surjectivity of the normal CR operator (see
                Prop. 2.2 of [Wen1]). If \(\ind(u) = 0\), then the latter is
                always nonpositive, so \(D^N_{u \circ \varphi}\) can be
                injective, and this condition has a geometric meaning (remember
                that sections of \(N_u\) can be considered as peturbations one
                can make to \(u\); alternatively, curves nearby \(u\) are
                perturbed by the sections of \(N_u\) via the exponential map):
                it implies that \(u \circ \varphi\) can never be the limit of a
                sequence of somewhere injective curves. In fact, the only other
                curves near \(u \circ \varphi\) are other branched covers of the
                form \(u \circ \varphi'\) for \(\varphi'\) near \(\varphi\).
                This is the notion of super-rigidity. We now state the theorem:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Theorem A (super-rigidity).</b> If \(\dim{M} \ge 6\), for
                generic \(J\), every simple index 0 JH curve is super-rigid.
                (i.e., a closed, connected simple curve, which satisfies the
                properties:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>\(\ind(u) = 0\).</li>
                <li>\(u : \Sigma \to M\) immersion.</li>
                <li>
                  \(\forall\) covers \(\Tilde{u} = u \circ \varphi\),
                  \(D^N_{\Tilde{u}} \eta\) is injective.)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Considerable interest in super-rigidity has been motivated by
                the study of Gromov-Witten invariants in Calabi-Yau 3-folds,
                where all moduli spaces of holomorphic curves have virtual
                dimension 0. If \((M,J)\) denotes a CY 3-fold (i.e., \(c_1(TM) =
                0\) and \(\dim{M} = 6\)) and \(\mathcal{M}_g(A,J)\) is the
                moduli space of unparametrized JH curves in \(M\) of genus \(g\)
                homologous to \(A \in H_2(M)\), then we have
                \(\virdim{\mathcal{M}_g(A,J)} = \ind(D(\delbar_J)) = 0\). We see
                trouble however once we consider mulitply covered curves. If \(v
                \in \mathcal{M}_h(A,J)\) and \(d \ge 2\), then \[
                \mathcal{M}_g(dA, J) \supset \{u = v \circ \varphi \st \varphi :
                \Sigma_g \to \Sigma_h \text{ a holomorphic branched cover}\} \]
                has dimension \(2 Z(\d \varphi) &gt; 0\) in general. But this
                contradicts transversality in the space of
                <i>all</i> (<i>not only</i> simple) curves as
                \(\ind(D(\delbar_J)) = 0\). This must mean \(\delbar_J
                \not\pitchfork 0\) for the full space of curves. This motivates
                the question if the intersection is atleast clean.

                <b>Conjecture</b> (“super-rigidity”, Bryan-Pandharipande 2001).
                For generic compatible \(J\) in a symplectic CY 3-fold,

                Note that clean intersection of \(\delbar_J\) with \(0\) is
                equivalent to the definition of super-rigidity given above, in
                particular, the condition that \(D^N_{u \circ \varphi}\) is

            <h3>The stratification theorem</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                The proofs of the above theorems use stratification (Theorem D).
                The idea is to study the local structure of spaces of the form
                \[ \mathcal{M}(k,c) := \{\Tilde{u} = u \circ \varphi \st
                \dim{\ker{D^N_{\Tilde{u}}}} = k \text{ and }
                \dim{\coker{D^N_{\Tilde{u}}}} = c\}, \] where \(k,c \ge 0\) are
                fixed integers, \(u\) varies in the moduli space of simple JH
                holomorphic curves and \(\varphi\) varies in the moduli space of
                holomorphic branched covers. Ideally, one would like to show
                that that these spaces are smooth manifolds for generic \(J\),
                and to compute their codimensions in the space of pairs
                \((u,\varphi)\). This turns Theorems A and B into “dimension
                counting” problems, as whenever one can show that the
                codimension of \(\mathcal{M}(k,c)\) is larger than the dimension
                of the ambient space for suitable values of \(k\) and \(c\), one
                may conclude that either \(\ker{D^N_{\Tilde{u}}}\) or
                \(\coker{D^N_{\Tilde{u}}}\) must be trivial. For a further
                discussion of wall-crossing arguments, refer [Wen1]. Note that
                this is a bootstrapping of the ideas of finite dimensional
                equivariant transversality mentioned earlier on top of
                equivariance of \(\delbar_J\) for multiple pseudoholomorphic
                covers. We now state the stratification result:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Theorem D (stratification).</b> “For generic \(J\), and for

                homology class \(A \in H_2(M)\) and tuples \(\mathbf{k} = (k_1,
                \dots, k_p)\) and \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \dots, c_p)\) of
                nonnegative integers corresponding to the \(p\) distinct
                irreducible real representations of \(G\), the subset \[
